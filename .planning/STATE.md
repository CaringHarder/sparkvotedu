## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All prior decisions archived in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions for v1.2:
- Deny-all RLS (no per-row policies) -- Prisma bypasses RLS via bypassrls user; deny-all locks PostgREST surface
- First-name identity over device fingerprint -- 24 students on identical Chromebooks produced only 6 fingerprints
- Additive schema migration -- keep device_id column (nullable), add first_name; no destructive changes

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Microsoft and Apple OAuth held -- code complete, needs console config (not blocking v1.2)
- FingerprintJS cleanup deferred to post-classroom-verification (CLEAN-01, CLEAN-02 in future requirements)
